- 👋 Hi, I’m @thewalkingbutterfly🦋...<br />

- 👀 I’m interested in everything code related for now... just a beginner tho... if we have to name it I would say I am a software developer enthusiast.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend Development on Codecademy, broadening my knowledge on SheCodes, studying Interactive Media for Games at Noroff, and dipping my feet in an introductory course for Computer Science and Game Development at HarvardX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me grow in knowledge. My interests are many and my goal is to fit as much info about the tech world as I can inside my stubborn little brain.
- 📫 How to reach me:<br />
