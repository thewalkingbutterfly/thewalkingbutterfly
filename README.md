- 👋 Hi, I’m @thewalkingbutterfly🦋...<br />

- 👀 I’m interested in everything code related for now... just a beginner tho... if we have to name it I would say a developer trainee.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend Development on Codecademy, broadening my knowledge on SheCodes, and studying Elements of AI on the University of Helsinki.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me grow in knowledge. My interests are many and my goal is to fit as much info about the tech world as I can inside my stubborn little brain.
- 📫 How to reach me:<br />
